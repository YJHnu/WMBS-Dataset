# WMBS

  The Whole Mouse Brain Sub-image (WMBS) dataset contains 34 volumetric images with single neuron surrounded by other neuronal structures. Also, images with multiple weak signal neurons are included. The size of each image is 1024 by 1024 by 100 voxels, and the resolution between X, Y and Z dimension is 0.2 by 0.2 by 1 Î¼m/voxel. The center of the images is the soma center of a neuron. In the dataset, all the critical points of the images are manually labeled. 

  The dataset is now avaiable from [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iY5VzAx9aeZMlnTJc81Gs2JJQBRSuMEo/view?usp=sharing)
